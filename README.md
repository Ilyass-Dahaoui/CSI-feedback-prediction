# CSI Feedback Prediction

##  Overview

This research project focuses on the prediction of **Channel State Information (CSI) feedback** in wireless communication systems using deep learning. CSI is a critical component in modern communication systems (e.g., 5G, MIMO) as it describes how a signal propagates between the transmitter and receiver. Efficient and accurate CSI feedback can significantly improve system performance, particularly for **massive MIMO** and **FDD** scenarios.

The main objective is to develop models that **reduce the feedback overhead** by accurately predicting CSI at the base station or user end.

## Key Features

- Deep learning-based CSI feedback compression and recovery
- Support for both **frequency-domain** and **time-domain** CSI
- Evaluation metrics tailored for wireless systems (e.g., NMSE, correlation)
- Modular code for dataset handling, training, and evaluation

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Matlab/Simulink
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- NumPy, SciPy
- h5py for CSI datasets
- Matplotlib for visualization

## Stay tuned for what's coming next!
- Extended support for other datasets (e.g., real-world OTA measurements)
- Lighter models for deployment on edge devices
- Benchmarking against state-of-the-art architectures
- Interactive demo and UI for visualization..........
